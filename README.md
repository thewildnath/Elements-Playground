# Elements-Playground

Written in C#, this project is more of a sandbox(pun intended) for me to test different programming techniques. It's target is to achieve a similar effect to that of "The Powder Toy" but with less computational resources. 
The game currently simulates basic density, temperature, fluid dynamics and electricity.

The toolbar at the bottom allow to choose from a moderately big variety of elements and tools.
